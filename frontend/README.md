# TX-STREAM

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Before running the application, ensure you have the following software installed on your machine:

- Node.js (v18.0.0 or higher)
- npm (v6.0.0 or higher) or yarn (v1.22.0 or higher)

### Installation

Follow these steps to install the required dependencies and run the application:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone -b frontend https://github.com/<your-username>/taxstream.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd taxstream
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn
   ```

### Development Server

To start the development server, run the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

This will launch the application in development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to view it.

### Building for Production

To build the application for production, use the following command:

```bash
npm run build
# or
yarn build
```

This will generate optimized production-ready files in the `dist` directory.
